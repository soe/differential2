### Diff view height fix

The _#diffview_ height is set by css

     #diffview { height: 600px; }

If there are too few lines to take up 600px, the _#diffview_ is auto-adjusted. If there are too many lines to fit into 600px then scroll is enabled.

### Scroll indicator

I have added in the scroll indicator to help user navigate through a long list of code.

### Scroll logic tweak for performance

Scroll logic is tweaked for performance.
